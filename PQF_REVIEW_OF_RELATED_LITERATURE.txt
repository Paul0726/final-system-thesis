Review of Related Literature - Philippine Qualifications Framework (PQF)

The Philippine Qualifications Framework (PQF) is a national policy framework established to describe the levels of educational qualifications and set standards for qualification outcomes in the Philippines. According to the PQF National Coordinating Council, the framework serves as a quality-assured system for developing, recognizing, and awarding qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skills, and values acquired through various learning pathways (PQF.gov.ph, n.d.).

The PQF operates on eight levels, with Level 6 corresponding to Bachelor's Degree programs. For Information Technology programs, Level 6 qualifications require graduates to demonstrate advanced technical knowledge, complex problem-solving skills, and professional competencies applicable to IT-related work environments. The framework aims to establish national standards and levels of learning outcomes, support pathways and equivalencies that enable access to qualifications, and align qualification standards with international frameworks to enhance recognition of Philippine qualifications globally.

Several studies have examined the relationship between tracer studies and qualification frameworks. According to research by educational institutions, tracer studies serve as essential tools for evaluating whether academic programs meet qualification framework standards by tracking graduate employment outcomes, career progression, and competency application in the workplace. These studies help institutions assess program effectiveness against national qualification standards and identify areas for curriculum improvement.

In the context of Information Technology education, research indicates that IT programs aligned with qualification frameworks demonstrate better employment outcomes for graduates. Studies show that graduates from programs that adhere to national qualification standards are more likely to secure employment in their field of study and demonstrate higher levels of technical competency in the workplace. The BSIT Graduate Tracer System contributes to this evaluation by collecting data on graduate employment status, IT field work classification, job placement success, and competency ratings - all of which serve as indicators of PQF Level 6 qualification outcomes.

The PQF emphasizes the importance of outcome-based education, where programs are evaluated based on the knowledge, skills, and values that graduates demonstrate in real-world settings. Tracer studies provide empirical evidence of these outcomes by tracking how graduates apply their acquired competencies in professional environments. The BSIT Graduate Tracer System aligns with this approach by systematically collecting data on graduate employment outcomes, IT field work application, and workplace competency assessments.

Research on qualification frameworks internationally has shown that countries with well-established qualification frameworks experience improved alignment between education and industry needs. The PQF serves this purpose in the Philippines by providing a common language for describing qualifications and facilitating better communication between educational institutions, employers, and graduates. Tracer studies, such as those conducted through the BSIT Graduate Tracer System, support this alignment by providing data on how graduates meet industry expectations and qualification standards.

The integration of technology in tracer study systems has been identified as a significant advancement in qualification framework evaluation. Web-based tracer systems enable more efficient data collection, real-time analysis, and comprehensive evaluation of graduate outcomes against qualification standards. The BSIT Graduate Tracer System represents this technological advancement, providing a platform for systematic assessment of BSIT program outcomes against PQF Level 6 standards.

Studies have also highlighted the importance of continuous quality improvement in maintaining alignment with qualification frameworks. Tracer studies provide valuable feedback for curriculum enhancement, ensuring that programs remain relevant to industry needs and continue to meet qualification standards. The BSIT Graduate Tracer System supports this continuous improvement process by collecting feedback from graduates about their educational experience and workplace readiness.

In conclusion, the Philippine Qualifications Framework provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating educational qualifications, and tracer studies serve as essential tools for assessing whether programs meet these standards. The BSIT Graduate Tracer System contributes to this evaluation by systematically tracking graduate outcomes and providing data that helps institutions ensure their BSIT programs align with PQF Level 6 standards for Information Technology qualifications.
