Review of Related Literature - Philippine Qualifications Framework

The Philippine Qualifications Framework (PQF) is a national policy framework established through Republic Act No. 10968 that describes the levels of educational qualifications and sets standards for qualification outcomes based on knowledge, skills, and values. The PQF operates on eight levels, with Level 6 corresponding to Bachelor's Degree programs including the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), where graduates are expected to demonstrate advanced technical knowledge, complex problem-solving skills, and professional competencies applicable to IT-related work environments. Tracer studies serve as essential tools for evaluating whether academic programs meet qualification framework standards by tracking graduate employment outcomes, career progression, and competency application in the workplace. Research indicates that IT programs aligned with qualification frameworks demonstrate better employment outcomes, with graduates more likely to secure employment in their field and demonstrate higher technical competency. The integration of technology in tracer study systems enables more efficient data collection, real-time analysis, and comprehensive evaluation of graduate outcomes against qualification standards, with automated systems providing more accurate and timely data compared to traditional manual methods. However, there is limited research on web-based tracer study systems specifically designed for BSIT programs that systematically collect and analyze data aligned with PQF Level 6 standards. This study addresses this gap by developing the BSIT Graduate Tracer System, a web-based application that systematically collects data on graduate employment outcomes, IT field work classification, job placement ratings, and competency assessments - all serving as indicators of PQF Level 6 qualification outcomes, providing institutions with a comprehensive tool for evaluating their BSIT program effectiveness against national qualification standards.
