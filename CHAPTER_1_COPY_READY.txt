CHAPTER 1
THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND

1.1 Introduction

Educational institutions face challenges in tracking and monitoring the career progression of their graduates. Tracer studies are essential tools for evaluating program effectiveness, assessing employment outcomes, and identifying areas for curriculum improvement. The Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program requires systematic methods to gather comprehensive data about alumni employment status and career paths.

Traditional tracer study methods involve manual data collection through paper-based surveys, phone interviews, or email correspondence. These approaches are time-consuming, costly, and result in data inconsistency and management difficulties. There is a growing need for automated, web-based solutions that can efficiently collect, manage, and analyze graduate data.

This study presents the development of the BSIT Graduate Tracer System, a web-based application designed to automate the process of tracking BSIT graduates. The system provides a platform for collecting graduate information, monitoring employment status, analyzing career progression, and gathering feedback. By leveraging modern web technologies including React.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, the system offers an efficient, secure, and user-friendly solution for conducting tracer studies.

1.2 Background of the Study

Tracer studies provide valuable insights into employment outcomes, program relevance to industry needs, and institutional effectiveness. For BSIT programs, these studies help identify whether graduates work in IT-related fields and assess curriculum alignment with industry requirements.

The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) establishes guidelines for the collection, processing, and protection of personal information in the Philippines. This legislation requires institutions to ensure transparency, legitimate purpose, informed consent, data minimization, and proper data security measures. Compliance with the Data Privacy Act is both a legal requirement and an ethical obligation to protect participant privacy and rights.

This system addresses the need for a modern, compliant, and efficient solution for conducting tracer studies while adhering to data privacy regulations through privacy-by-design principles.

1.3 Statement of the Problem

Traditional methods of conducting tracer studies for BSIT graduates present several challenges:

1. Inefficient Data Collection: Manual methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive.
2. Data Management Difficulties: Spreadsheets and paper records make it challenging to maintain data integrity and generate reports.
3. Limited Data Analysis: Lack of tools for data visualization and statistical analysis hinders insight generation.
4. Lack of Real-time Updates: Traditional methods do not allow for real-time data collection and updates.
5. Data Privacy Compliance Challenges: Ensuring compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 requires proper documentation and secure procedures difficult to implement manually.
6. Limited Alumni Engagement: Without an accessible platform, graduates may be less motivated to participate, resulting in low response rates.
7. Insufficient Feedback Collection: Traditional methods may not effectively capture detailed feedback about the program.

1.4 Objectives of the Study

1.4.1 General Objective

4. To develop a public dashboard displaying statistical insights and visualizations of graduate employment outcomes.
5. To implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data security.
6. To incorporate data privacy compliance features in accordance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012.
7. To provide a user-friendly interface that encourages graduate participation.
8. To implement data export functionality for generating reports and analysis.
9. To ensure the system is accessible across different devices with responsive design.
10. To evaluate the system's effectiveness and compliance with data privacy regulations.

1.5 Significance of the Study
